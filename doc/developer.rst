 Developer’s notes
===================

This file contains notes for developing Annotald.

Documentation
-------------

The Annotald documentation is built with `Sphinx
<http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_.  You’ll need to install that program along
with the `alabaster theme <https://github.com/bitprophet/alabaster>`_ in
order to build the documentation.  Once those prerequisites are
fulfilled, typing ``make docs`` in the root directory will build the
documentation into the ``build/docs`` directory.
